Artifact
======

Artifact is the resulting porject from ForeignGuyMike about [creating a 2D platform game tutorial serie](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-2t7SM0vDfcIedoMIghzzgQqZq45jYGv) on YouTube.

After some days of trying to hack this, I finally refactor the project to extract game framework from game.
