Artifact
======

Artifact is the resulting porject from ForeignGuyMike about [creating a 2D platform game tutorial serie](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-2t7SM0vDfcIedoMIghzzgQqZq45jYGv) on YouTube.

After some days of trying to hack this, I finally refactor the project to extract game framework from game. 

Small transformation has been operated:

### The main menu

* A new entry was added to route to Options screen.

Main menu

* Here is the new option srceen, giving access to language selection

<img style="width:500px; box-shadow: 6px 6px 12px #555;margin:4px; border:2px #fff;" alt="Options menu" src="docs/artifact-options.png" title="Options menu" />

* And the well known Level 1 screen, but with the new refactored framework.
